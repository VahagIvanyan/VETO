                            Veto for J-PET
                            --------------

   Energy deposition of Muons with cosine square theta distribution and 4 GeV energy on Veto plastic and J_PET plastic scintillators.
The program calculates Efficiency of detection in Veto and in J-PET per scintillator and for all the multiplicities, as well as,rejection  efficiencies.
